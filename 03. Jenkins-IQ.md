# **Jenkins Interview Questions **

---

## **21. Describe your typical deployment flow and CI/CD workflow.**

### **Real Project Workflow**

1. **Developer pushes code** → GitHub
2. **Webhook triggers Jenkins**
3. Jenkins **checks out code**
4. **Build stage**

   * Maven/Gradle/Node
5. **Unit Test stage**
6. **Code Quality Analysis**

   * SonarQube
7. **Docker Image Build**
8. **Push Image to Registry**

   * Docker Hub / ECR
9. **Deploy to Kubernetes/EKS**

   * Using kubectl/helm
10. **Post-deployment validation**
11. **Notifications**

* Slack/MS Teams

### **Interview Answer**

“My typical CI/CD flow starts from commit → webhook → Jenkins build/test → Sonar → Docker → registry → Kubernetes deployment. I ensure quality gates, automated checks, and rollback mechanisms are in place.”

---

## **22. What stages do you define in your Jenkins pipeline, and how do you ensure full quality checks during deployment?**

### **Stages I Use**

1. Checkout
2. Build
3. Unit Test
4. Static Code Analysis (SonarQube)
5. Security Scan (Trivy/OWASP)
6. Docker Build
7. Push to Registry
8. Deploy to Dev
9. Manual Approval for QA/Prod
10. Deploy to QA/Prod
11. Smoke Tests
12. Notifications

### **Ensuring Quality**

* Enforce SonarQube **Quality Gate**
* Use **Trivy** for image scanning
* Run **JUnit** / **pytest**
* Use **approval gates** for production
* Validate deployment with post-deploy checks

### **Interview Answer**

“I enforce SonarQube quality gates, run unit tests, security scans, and smoke tests. Only when all checks pass, Jenkins promotes the build to higher environments.”

---

## **23. How do you use Jenkins Shared Libraries? Structure + Integration.**

### **Structure**

```
├── vars/
│     ├── buildApp.groovy
│     ├── deployApp.groovy
├── src/org/company/library/
│     ├── Util.groovy
```

### **Usage**

**In Jenkinsfile:**

```
@Library('company-shared-library') _
buildApp()
deployApp()
```

### **Real Use-Case**

* Standardizing build logic across 50+ microservices
* Avoids repeating repetitive code
* Version-controlled pipeline logic

### **Interview Answer**

“I use shared libraries to centralize repeated steps like build, test, deploy. Jenkins pulls the library repo and we call functions inside Jenkins files using `@Library` notation.”

---

## **24. You want to store secrets in a Jenkins pipeline. How do you do it?**

### **Ways to Store Secrets**

1. **Jenkins Credentials Store**

   * Secret Text
   * Username/Password
   * SSH Private Key
   * AWS Credentials
2. Use in pipeline:

```
withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'token', variable: 'MY_TOKEN')]) {
    sh "curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer $MY_TOKEN'"
}
```

3. Use **Jenkins Vault plugin** (Optional)

   * Integrate HashiCorp Vault

### **Interview Answer**

“I store all secrets in Jenkins Credentials Store and access them securely using `withCredentials` so they never show in console logs.”

---

## **25. How does AWS CodePipeline differ from Jenkins? When would you choose one over the other?**

### **Comparison**

| Feature          | Jenkins            | AWS CodePipeline |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Self-managed     | Yes                | No               |
| Plugin ecosystem | Huge               | Limited          |
| Flexibility      | Very High          | Medium           |
| Scaling          | Manual             | Automatic        |
| Cost             | Free (self-hosted) | Pay per usage    |
| Maintenance      | High               | Zero             |

### **When to choose which?**

* **Use Jenkins** if:

  * You have complex pipelines
  * You need custom logic
  * You use multiple tools (Sonar, Docker, Kubernetes)

* **Use AWS CodePipeline** if:

  * You want a fully managed service
  * You want deep AWS integration
  * Small/medium workloads

### **Interview Answer**

“I choose Jenkins for complex, multi-step pipelines and CodePipeline for AWS-native apps that benefit from managed CI/CD and no server maintenance.”

---

## **26. How would you deploy a Kubernetes application using Jenkins? What plugins/tools do you use?**

### **Tools Used**

* Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
* Helm
* Jenkins Kubernetes Plugin
* AWS CLI (for EKS)
* Docker
* ECR or Docker Hub

### **Pipeline Steps**

1. Build → test → sonar
2. Build Docker image
3. Push to registry
4. Create kubeconfig dynamically
5. Deploy to K8s:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

   OR using Helm:

   ```
   helm upgrade --install app chart/
   ```

### **Interview Answer**

“I deploy to Kubernetes by generating kubeconfig in Jenkins, using kubectl or Helm to apply manifests, and ensuring proper RBAC permissions for the Jenkins service account.”

---

## **27. Jenkins jobs are randomly failing at the artifact upload step. What layers do you check?**

### **Layers to Check**

**1. Jenkins Layer**

* Agent disk space
* Jenkins master-agent communication
* Credentials

**2. Network Layer**

* Proxy
* Firewall
* Internet drop for cloud registries

**3. Artifact Storage Layer**

* S3/Artifactory/Nexus availability
* Access policies
* Rate limits

**4. Application Layer**

* Misconfigured paths
* Wrong artifact name
* Build tool errors

### **Interview Answer**

“I troubleshoot artifact upload issues by checking network stability, credentials, storage system health (S3/Nexus), agent disk space, and verifying upload endpoints.”

---

## **28. How does authentication happen in Jenkins pipeline to use AWS if you have logged out?**

### **Explanation**

AWS credentials **do not depend on your local login**.

In Jenkins, authentication happens via:

1. **AWS Credentials plugin**
2. **IAM User access key stored in Jenkins**
3. **IRSA (IAM Role for Service Accounts)** – best for EKS
4. **AssumeRole Step:**

   ```
   withAWS(role: 'my-role', roleAccount: '123456789', region: 'ap-south-1') {
       sh "aws s3 ls"
   }
   ```

### **Interview Answer**

“AWS authentication in Jenkins is done using stored IAM credentials or role assumption, not based on my personal AWS login. Even if I log out locally, Jenkins uses stored credentials.”

---

## **29. Explain how you set up SonarQube in CI Jenkins pipeline, quality gates, and threshold checks.**

### **Integration Steps**

1. Install the **SonarQube Scanner plugin**
2. Configure **Sonar server** + Token
3. Add `withSonarQubeEnv` block
4. Run `sonar-scanner`
5. Add **Quality Gate**:

   ```
   waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true
   ```
6. Define thresholds in SonarQube:

   * Coverage ≥ 80%
   * Bugs = 0
   * Vulnerabilities = 0
   * Code smells < 15

### **Use Developer Test Reports**

* JUnit / Jacoco generated coverage
* Jenkins publishes reports
* SonarQube reads them for quality gate

### **Interview Answer**

“I integrated SonarQube using scanner plugin, enforced `waitForQualityGate`, and configured coverage thresholds using Jacoco reports. Pipeline fails automatically if code quality does not meet standards.”

---

## **30. Have you faced memory issues in Jenkins pipeline? How do you troubleshoot?**

### **Symptoms**

* Jenkins agent disconnecting
* Build failing with OOMKilled
* JVM Heap Space errors
* Docker build out-of-memory

### **Troubleshooting Steps**

1. **Increase JVM memory** in `/etc/default/jenkins`

   ```
   -Xms512m -Xmx2048m
   ```
2. **Increase agent RAM/CPU**
3. **Workspace Cleanup**
4. **Disable parallel heavy builds**
5. **Add swap space**
6. **Check memory usage:**

   ```
   top
   free -m
   ```

### **Interview Answer**

“I troubleshoot Jenkins memory issues by increasing JVM heap memory, scaling agents, cleaning workspace, optimizing Docker builds, and monitoring with tools like `top`, `htop`, Grafana dashboards.”
