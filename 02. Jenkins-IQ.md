# Jenkins Interview Questions 

---

## **11. A Jenkins pipeline is randomly failing at the deployment stage to EKS. Logs show timeouts during `kubectl apply`. What will you do?**

### **Scenario**

Deployment to EKS sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails with:

```
Unable to connect to the server: net/http timeout
```

### **Root Causes (Real Project Issues)**

* Jenkins agent cannot reach EKS API endpoint
* Cluster endpoint is private
* Network/VPC issue
* Expired AWS auth token
* kubeconfig not updated
* Throttling from AWS IAM authentication

### **Troubleshooting Steps**

1. **Check connectivity from Jenkins node:**

   ```
   curl https://<EKS-ENDPOINT>
   ```
2. **Regenerate kubeconfig:**

   ```
   aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster>
   ```
3. **Check AWS IAM token expiry**
   EKS tokens are valid only for **15 minutes**.
4. **Use IAM Role for Service Account (IRSA) instead of credentials**
5. **Check if cluster is in private subnet**
   Jenkins must have access via VPN/Peering.
6. **Increase kubectl timeout:**

   ```
   kubectl apply --request-timeout=60s
   ```

### **Interview Answer**

“I check AWS token expiration, kubeconfig validity, network connectivity to EKS endpoint, and ensure the Jenkins agent has VPC access. Most intermittent failures occur due to expired IAM tokens or private endpoint access restrictions.”

## **12. You are using Jenkins as open-source. Which AWS service is equivalent for CI/CD?**

### **Answer**

AWS offers fully managed CI/CD services:

* **AWS CodeCommit** – Git repo
* **AWS CodeBuild** – Build service
* **AWS CodeDeploy** – Deployment service
* **AWS CodePipeline** – Orchestration

### **Interview Answer**

“In AWS, CodePipeline is the fully managed alternative to Jenkins. It integrates with CodeCommit/CodeBuild/CodeDeploy to create a complete CI/CD workflow without server maintenance.”

## **13. Different plugins for CI/CD in Jenkins when using AWS**

### **Common AWS Plugins**

1. **AWS Credentials Plugin**
2. **AWS Steps Plugin**
3. **Amazon ECR Plugin**
4. **Amazon EC2 Plugin**
5. **S3 Publisher Plugin**
6. **AWS Lambda Plugin**
7. **Pipeline AWS Plugin**
8. **CloudWatch Logs Plugin**

### **Interview Answer**

“I commonly use AWS Credentials, ECR, EC2, S3, and Pipeline-AWS plugins. These allow Jenkins pipelines to authenticate with AWS, publish artifacts, manage EC2 agents, and store artifacts in S3.”

## **14. Why do you want to use Argo CD over Jenkins?**

### **Simple Comparison**

| Feature   | Jenkins | Argo CD   |
| --------- | ------- | --------- |
| CI        | Yes     | No        |
| CD (K8s)  | Basic   | Excellent |
| GitOps    | No      | Yes       |
| Auto-sync | No      | Yes       |
| Rollbacks | Manual  | Automatic |

### **Interview Answer**

“I use Jenkins for CI tasks like building and testing. For Kubernetes deployments, Argo CD is better because it is GitOps native, supports declarative deployments, automatic sync, drift detection, version rollback, and visual dashboards. It reduces operational overhead compared to Jenkins.”

---

## **15. Explain the CI/CD workflow you follow and the kind of pipeline you use. How do you define and invoke pipelines in Jenkins?**

### **My Real Project Workflow**

1. Developer pushes code → GitHub
2. Webhook triggers Jenkins
3. Jenkins pipeline:

   * Checkout
   * Build
   * Unit Test
   * SonarQube
   * Build Docker Image
   * Push to registry
   * Deploy to Kubernetes/EKS
4. Notifications to Slack/Teams.

### **How I invoke pipelines**

* Using Jenkinsfile stored in repo.
* Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline detects branches and builds automatically using webhooks.

### **Interview Answer**

“I follow a Jenkinsfile-based CI/CD workflow where the pipeline is triggered via webhook. The pipeline includes build, test, quality checks, image creation, push to registry, and deployment. I use declarative pipelines for clarity and multibranch pipelines for automatic branch discovery.”

## **16. What are shared libraries in Jenkins, and how are they written and used?**

### **Scenario**

You want to avoid repeating common steps across multiple pipelines.

### **Structure**

```
(vars)
    build.groovy
    deploy.groovy
(src)
    org/company/library/*.groovy
```

### **Usage in Jenkinsfile**

```
@Library('my-shared-library') _
build()
deploy()
```

### **Interview Answer**

“Jenkins Shared Libraries allow reusing common pipeline code like build, test, deploy functions. They are stored in a separate Git repo with a standard structure (vars/, src/) and imported using @Library annotation.”

---

## **17. What kind of applications do you deploy using Jenkins pipelines, and what deployment tools do you use?**

### **Interview Answer**

“I deploy microservices, Java Spring Boot applications, Angular/React frontends, and containerized apps. For deployment tools, I use Docker, Kubernetes (kubectl/helm), AWS CodeDeploy, and Ansible depending on project needs.”

---

## **18. If the Jenkins pipeline runs but the build doesn’t happen, what issues could be causing it?**

### **Possible Issues**

1. Wrong build tool (Maven/Gradle) not installed on Jenkins agent
2. Wrong path to pom.xml or build.gradle
3. Workspace cleanup removed necessary files
4. Agent running with incorrect permissions
5. Build stage skipped due to condition (`when` block)
6. Wrong branch checkout
7. Build command is wrong

### **Interview Answer**

“I check build tool installation, correct paths, agent permissions, branch checkout, pipeline conditions, and verify whether the developer committed required build files.”

---

## **20. What is the purpose of a webhook, and how is it used in a CI/CD pipeline?**

### **Explanation**

Webhook = automatic trigger sent from GitHub/GitLab whenever code is pushed.

### **Use in CI/CD**

* Webhook calls Jenkins endpoint:

  ```
  http://jenkins-url:8080/github-webhook/
  ```
* Jenkins automatically starts the pipeline.
* No need for periodic polling.

### **Interview Answer**

“A webhook automatically triggers Jenkins when developers push changes. It enables instant CI/CD without waiting for scheduled polling, making pipelines faster and resource-efficient.”
