#  Jenkins Interview Questions 

---

## **31. Can you explain how you would deploy a Kubernetes application using Jenkins? What plugins or tools would you use?**

(This is similar to Q26, but here is a full real-project explanation.)

### **Tools Used**

* Docker
* AWS ECR / Docker Hub
* Kubectl
* Helm
* AWS CLI (for EKS)
* Kubernetes CLI Plugin
* Jenkins Kubernetes Credentials Provider

### **Pipeline Flow**

1. **Checkout code**
2. **Run unit tests**
3. **Run SonarQube analysis**
4. **Build Docker image + push to registry**
5. **Generate kubeconfig dynamically**
6. **Deploy using either:**

   * `kubectl apply -f manifests/`
   * or `helm upgrade --install`

### **Example Snippet**

```
stage('Deploy to EKS') {
    withCredentials([[$class: 'AmazonWebServicesCredentialsBinding', credentialsId: 'aws']] ) {
        sh """
        aws eks update-kubeconfig --name demo-cluster --region ap-south-1
        helm upgrade --install app chart/
        """
    }
}
```

### **Interview Answer**

“I deploy applications to Kubernetes using Jenkins by pushing images to ECR and deploying with kubectl or Helm. Jenkins authenticates using AWS credentials and dynamically generates kubeconfig for deployment.”

## **32. Jenkins jobs are randomly failing at the artifact upload step. What layers would you check?**

(This is duplicate of Q27 but I will give deeper real-case troubleshooting.)

### **Detailed Layers to Check**

1. **Jenkins Node Layer**

   * Disk full
   * Node going offline
   * Workspace corruption

2. **Network Layer**

   * Latency
   * Firewall rules
   * DNS issues

3. **Artifact Storage**

   * S3 bucket permission denied
   * Nexus/Artifactory storage full
   * Upload API throttling

4. **Credentials Layer**

   * Expired AWS keys
   * Wrong IAM policy (missing `s3:PutObject`)

5. **Pipeline Layer**

   * Wrong file path
   * Wrong artifact version number

### **Interview Answer**

“I troubleshoot layer by layer—Jenkins node health, network connectivity, artifact store permissions, IAM policies, and verify correct upload paths. Intermittent failures are usually due to network instability or permission throttling.”

---

## **33. How does authentication happen in Jenkins pipeline to use AWS with particular login, if you have logged out?**

### **Key Concept**

AWS authentication in Jenkins **does NOT depend on your local AWS login**.

### **How Authentication Works**

* Jenkins uses AWS credentials stored in **Jenkins Credentials Store**.
* Pipeline loads them at runtime using:

  ```
  withAWS(credentials: 'aws-cred-id') {
      sh 'aws s3 ls'
  }
  ```
* OR via **IAM role assumption**.

### **Interview Answer**

“Jenkins authenticates using stored IAM credentials or assumes roles through the AWS Credentials plugin. It is completely independent of my local AWS console login.”

---

## **34. What is a publisher in Jenkins?**

### **Explanation**

Publisher = **Post-Build Action** executed after a job completes.

### **Examples**

* Archive artifacts
* Publish JUnit test results
* Send email notifications
* Push artifacts to S3/Nexus
* Notify Slack
* Trigger downstream jobs

### **Interview Answer**

“A publisher in Jenkins is a post-build action such as archiving artifacts, publishing test results, emailing reports, or sending notifications. It runs after the build stage completes.”

---

## **35. How can you create a new copy of an existing Jenkins job?**

### **Ways:**

1. **Using Jenkins UI**

   * Go to **New Item → Copy from existing job**
   * Enter the source job name

2. **Using Job Configuration XML (advanced)**

   * Copy job folder under `/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/`

3. **Using Jenkins Job DSL plugin**

### **Interview Answer**

“To copy a job, I create a new job and select 'Copy from Existing Job'. Jenkins clones the configuration including pipeline script, environment variables, and build triggers.”

---

## **36. Have you faced any memory issue in Jenkins pipeline? How would you troubleshoot it?**

*(Already answered earlier, giving extended version here.)*

### **Troubleshooting Memory Problems**

1. **JVM Heap Size**
   Increase in `JAVA_OPTS`:

   ```
   -Xmx2g -Xms1g
   ```

2. **Agent Memory Leaks**

   * Restart agents
   * Move large Docker builds to dedicated high-memory agents

3. **Workspace Cleanup**

   * Enable **Workspace Cleanup Plugin**

4. **Docker Memory Limits**

   * Set `--memory` flag in Docker

5. **Monitor via Grafana**

   * Jenkins exporter → Prometheus

### **Interview Answer**

“I troubleshoot memory issues by increasing JVM heap, scaling agent resources, cleaning workspace, optimizing builds, and using Prometheus/Grafana to find memory leaks.”

---

## **37. Explain your experience with CI/CD pipeline using Docker, Grafana, and Prometheus. Provide a real project example.**

### **Real-Time Example**

**Project:** Microservices-based healthcare project.

### **CI/CD Using Jenkins**

1. **Build → Test → SonarQube → Docker Image**
2. Push image to ECR
3. Deploy to EKS via Helm

### **Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana**

* Prometheus scrapes:

  * Node metrics
  * Application metrics
  * Jenkins node metrics
* Grafana dashboard shows:

  * CPU/Mem
  * Pod restarts
  * Error rates

### **Usage**

* Auto alerts for pod crash loops
* Deployment success validation

### **Interview Answer**

“I used Jenkins for building Docker images and deploying to Kubernetes. Prometheus and Grafana monitored pod health, deployments, and pipeline behaviour. This helped us catch failures early using automated alerts.”

---

## **38. Suppose manual intervention is required after building the image. How would you configure it in Jenkins? Where is it used?**

### **Use Case**

* Approval required to deploy to QA/Prod
* Security team review
* Client approval before production

### **How to Configure**

1. Use **Input Step**:

   ```
   stage('Approval') {
       input message: 'Approve deployment to PROD?'
   }
   ```
2. Or use **Slack approval plugin**
3. Or **Jira/ServiceNow approval** integration

### **Interview Answer**

“I use Jenkins Input Step or Slack approval to pause the pipeline and wait for manual approval before deploying to the next environment.”

---

## **39. CI/CD pipeline needs rollback capability. How would you implement it?**

### **Approaches**

1. **Using Kubernetes Rollback**

   ```
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/app
   ```

2. **Using Helm version history**

   ```
   helm rollback app 3
   ```

3. **Tag stable Docker images**

   * Always keep last successful image
   * Maintain versioning

4. **Git Revert + Pipeline Trigger**

### **Interview Answer**

“I implement rollback using Helm or Kubernetes rollout undo. Jenkins automatically triggers rollback using the previous successful artifact stored in ECR and versioned Helm charts.”

---

## **40. How are you integrating SonarQube with Jenkins server?**

*(Repeated question but here is a complete polished version.)*

### **Steps**

1. Install **SonarQube Scanner** plugin
2. Add Sonar server and token
3. Configure SonarScanner in Global Tool Configuration
4. Use Jenkinsfile:

   ```
   withSonarQubeEnv('sonar-server') {
       sh 'sonar-scanner'
   }
   waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true
   ```

### **Interview Answer**

“I configured SonarQube using scanner plugin, stored the token in Jenkins credentials, and added quality gate checks to enforce code quality.”

---

## **41. How are you integrating the SonarQube with the Jenkins server?**

(Answered above—same explanation applies.)

---

## **42. How are you integrating the SonarQube with the Jenkins server?**

(Answered above—same explanation applies.)

---

## **43. If the code passes in Jenkins pipeline and gets deployed but later encounters issues in production, how do we resolve it?**

### **Real-Time Troubleshooting Flow**

1. **Check Jenkins build logs**
2. **Check Kubernetes/ECS logs**

   * Pod restart?
   * Env variable mismatch?
3. **Check DB connection issues**
4. **Check secrets/configMaps**
5. **Check monitoring tools (Grafana/Prometheus)**
6. **Reproduce issue in lower environment**
7. **Rollback deployment if required**

### **Most Common Causes**

* Wrong config in production
* Docker image tagging mistakes
* Missing environment-specific properties

### **Interview Answer**

“I diagnose issues by checking application logs, config differences, secrets, and environment variables. If production is unstable, I immediately roll back using previous working version and start debugging.”

---

## **44. Explain the steps in creating a CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Spring Boot application to ECS.**

### **Steps**

1. **Developer pushes code**
2. **Jenkins triggered by webhook**
3. **Checkout code**
4. **Build using Maven**
5. **Run tests**
6. **SonarQube analysis**
7. **Docker build**
8. **Push image to ECR**
9. **Create/Update ECS Task Definition**
10. **Update ECS Service**
11. **Trigger new deployment**
12. **Verify health checks**

### **Tools**

* AWS CLI
* ECS Plugin
* ECR Plugin
* Docker
* SonarQube

### **Interview Answer**

“I use Jenkins to build/test the Spring Boot app, push the Docker image to ECR, update ECS Task Definition automatically, and trigger a new ECS deployment. This ensures automated, zero-downtime deployments.”
